# BaiWikiPages

## Repo Description
This is a small repository consisting of some tutorials I made for the Peng Bai group.
Some of the links may make references to files from the groups' SharePoint. I removed these links as they're
only group accessible but if possible I'll try to find replacement links for the information.

## File Description
- `*.txt` files are the text files straight from the group wiki in the wikimedia format. 
- `*.md` files are converted to github markdown using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)

## To-Dos
- Automate `*.txt` and `*.md` generation when the group wiki is updated using Github Actions
